  <h2>3. Optional Contact</h2>
  <p>In rare cases, we may need to contact you in relation to your use of the app, especially to assist with technical issues, to comply with legal requirements, or when required by authorized enforcement or legal bodies.</p>

  <h2>4. Legal Compliance</h2>
  <p>We reserve the right to share information with legal authorities if required by law, court order, or government regulation — within the scope permitted by applicable legislation.</p>

  <h2>5. Analytics & Advertising</h2>
